# About this Documentation

The goal of this documentation is to comprehensively explain the CLib API, both from a reference as well as a conceptual point of view. Each section describes a built-in module.

Where appropriate, property types, method arguments, and the arguments provided to event handlers are detailed in a list underneath the topic heading.

Every document is generated based on the corresponding `.md` file in the `docs/` folder in CLib's source tree. The documentation is generated using Docsify.


If errors are found in this documentation, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/TaktiCool/CLib/issues/new).
