# About this Documentation

The goal of this codumentation is to cempregensively explain the CLib API, both from a reference as well as a conceptual point of view. Each section describes a built-in module.

Where appropriate, property types, method arguments, and the arguments provided to event handlers are detailed in a list underneath the topic heading.

Every document is generated based on the corresponding `.md` file in the `doc/` folder in CLib's source tree. The documentation is generated using a markdown parser.
