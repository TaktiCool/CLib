    Description:
    Very dirty solution to check if a file exists. Every file type need to be added at allowedHTMLLoadExtensions in the server config file.

    Parameter(s):
    0: File Path with Filename <String> (Default: "")

    Returns:
    File exist <Bool>
*/

params [
    ["_file", "", [""]]
];

private _ctrl = (findDisplay 0) ctrlCreate ["RscHTML", -1];
_ctrl htmlLoad _file;
private _return = ctrlHTMLLoaded _ctrl;
ctrlDelete _ctrl;
_return;
